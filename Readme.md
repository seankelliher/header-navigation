# Header and Navigation

A responsive header and single-level navigation bar for websites. On larger screens, the navigation bar has a horizontal orientation with items cascading left to right; positioned by flexbox. On smaller screens, the horizontal navigation is replaced by a button. Click the button: a navigation bar with a vertical orientation (items cascading top to bottom, no flexbox) appears. In both environments, the current page is highlighted using a JavaScript function. The navigation has minimal styling. You may want to add more for a production model. All functionality is accomplished with "vanilla" JavaScript
