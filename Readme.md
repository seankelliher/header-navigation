## Installation and Setup Instructions

This is a static component. All you need is a web browser.

## Reflection

I wanted to build a reusable header and navigation that would adapt to different screen sizes. On smaller and medium-sized screens, the navigation would display as a "hamburger." On larger screens, the navigation would display horizontally across the page. It is a routine task, but still requires effort and planning. The more challenging aspect was building to accommodate user behavior: ensuring the elements would react and display properly if users manually made their browser windows larger or smaller.
